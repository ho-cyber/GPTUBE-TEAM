As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 approached, Osama bin Laden was determined to carry out another terrorist attack against the United States. After years of surveillance and planning, on April 29th, President Obama and his National Security team were briefed on Operation Neptune's Spear - a mission that was aimed at capturing the world's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden.

On May 1st, President Obama gave the go-ahead for the mission. For the next two hours, he and his team watched through night vision images as Navy SEAL Team Six used explosives to enter the compound where bin Laden was believed to be hiding. After several minutes of searching, they found him unarmed in a bedroom on the third floor.

At 12:35am, President Obama was informed that bin Laden had been killed. His body was carried back to one of the helicopters and taken away, but it was uncertain if the body was actually bin Laden's or not. After almost 5 hours of waiting, at 11:35pm, the announcement was made that the United States had successfully conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden.

The death of the world's most wanted man is a major victory for the United States and for world peace. It serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilantly monitoring our enemies and being prepared to act when necessary. The success of Operation Neptune's Spear serves as a testament to the strength and determination of the United States and its allies in the fight against terrorism.
